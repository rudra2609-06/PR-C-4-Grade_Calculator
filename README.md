- Calculate grade based on the following criteria:
  - A: 90 - 100
  - B: 80 - 89
  - C: 70 - 79
  - D: 60 - 69
  - E: 50 - 59
  - F: Below 50
- Display a message based on the grade.
- Inform the user if they are eligible for the next level.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
   ```bash
   gcc grade_calculator.c -o grade_calculator
   ```
2. Run the compiled program.
   ```bash
   ./grade_calculator
   ```
3. Enter the marks when prompted.
4. View the calculated grade and feedback.

## Code Explanation
- The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the grade based on the input marks.
